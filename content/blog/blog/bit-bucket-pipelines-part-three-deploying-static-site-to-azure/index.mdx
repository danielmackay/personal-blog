## Intro
In Part 1 of this series, we walked through the basics of Bit Bucket Pipelines and how to build and test a .NET Core app.

In Part 2 of this series we walked through how to publish the .NET Core application and deploy it to a Web App in Azure.

In Part 3 of this series we will see how to build and publish a react application to Azure Blob storage.

## Creating our React App
First, we need to create a frontend application.  We could use any frontend framework such as Angular, Vue, or even plain HTML.  My personal preference is React.

Let's use create react app to scaffold out a typescript based application.

NOTE: I'm doing this via WSL 2 (Ubuntu) on Windows.

```
npx create-react-app react-pipelines --template typescript
```

Navigate to our new application:

```
cd react-pipelines
```

And after a small tweak to `App.tsx` we run:

```
yarn start
```

And voila:

![React App](./react-app.png)

## Building
We can easily build, test, and package our react app with the following pipeline:

```yaml
image: node:10.15.3

pipelines:
  default:
    - step:
        caches:
          - node
        script:
          - yarn install
          - yarn test --all --forceExit
          - yarn build
        artifacts:
          - build/**
```

If all has gone well we will see our successful build:

![Successful Build](./successful-build.png)

## Deployment

### Azure Storage
Before we can deploy, we need somewhere to.  For the brevity of this blog post, I'll assume you already have an Azure Subscription and know how to create a Storage Account.

Once we have our storage account we need to configure it as a static site like so:

![Storage Static Site](./storage-static-site.png)

We will also need to generate a Shared Access Secret which will be used to allow our pipeline to publish to our blob storage account.  This can be done as follows:

![SAS](./sas.png)

Copy the SAS Token generated from the screen as we will use that in our pipeline configuration.

### Pipeline Configuration
To deploy our static site we will need to setup a deployment as follows:

```yaml
- step:
    name: Deploy to test
    deployment: test
    trigger: manual  
    script:
    - pipe: microsoft/azure-storage-deploy:2.0.1
        variables:
        SOURCE: 'build/**'
        DESTINATION: 'https://reactpipelines.blob.core.windows.net/%24web/'
        DESTINATION_SAS_TOKEN: $SAS_TOKEN
        EXTRA_ARGS: '--from-to localBlob --recursive'
```
The `SOURCE` variable needs to match our artifact from the previous step.  The `DESTINATION` variable is set to the URL of our blob account.  Note, that this is NOT the same as the public URL for your static website.  We need to URL encode the `$web` directory which gives us the `%24web` portion of the URL.  The `EXTRA_ARGS` tell the pipe that we are copying from the local machine (i.e. the docker image) to blob storage.

The `$SAS_TOKEN` we will securely store as a repository variable as follows:

![Repo Variable](./repo-variables.png)

A few fixed builds later, if all has gone well we will get a successful build and deployment:

![Successful Deployment](./successful-deployment.png)

And our react site will be live!

![Live Site](./live-site.png)

## Summary
In this article we've seen how easy it is to create a react application via create-react-app, create a pipeline to build and test our app.  Additionally, we've seen how to configure Azure storage to host a static website, and how to deploy our react app to that site.

This concludes the end of our 3 part series on Bit Bucket Pipelines.  I hope that I've helped you to see how easy some of these tasks are to setup in pipelines (especially when you have a working example to copy from ðŸ˜‰).

Happy pipelines!
